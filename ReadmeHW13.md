### For HW 1 exercise 3...


I am hoping to resolve my github repository/local direcotry communication issues soon, but in the meantime my script and .csv can be accessed from my stat679work home direcory or with the following hyperlinks: the HW1 exercise 3 script [here](https://github.com/kingcohn1/stat679work/blob/master/hw1.3.shhw1.3.sh.).
And my .csv output file can be located [here](https://github.com/kingcohn1/stat679work/blob/master/HW13.csv).
