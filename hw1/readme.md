#In order to start this assignment I first obtained raw data directories (log and out) from git repository: git clone git@github.com:UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata.git.

# I began exercise 1 using my MacBook OSX 10.7.5 and as up-to-date libraries as possible. I created a directory on my desktop stat679work and transformed it as a git repository following the instructions on https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata/blob/master/readme.md.
